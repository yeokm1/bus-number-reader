==========

This repository is for my team's work at the code::XtremeApps:: 2014 Hackathon.  It comprises of both the Raspberry Pi Node.js and Python code as well as the Arduino code. Bear in mind this is hackathon quality code, a messy proof-of-concept.

Please read my blog post http://yeokhengmeng.com/2014/07/codextremeapps-2014-aar/ for more details

bus_reader.py requires Adafruit_CharLCDPlate library. https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Python_CharLCD    

bus.js requires the bleno library. Just "npm install".
